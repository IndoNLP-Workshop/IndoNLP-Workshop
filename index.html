    <h2>Workshop description</h2>


    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The rapid advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the
        landscape of computational linguistics. However, Indo-Aryan and Dravidian Languages (IADL),
        which represent a significant portion of South Asia's linguistic heritage,
        remain under-resourced and under-researched in these technological developments.
        This workshop aims to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers, linguists, and technologists to focus on
        the unique challenges and
        opportunities. Participants will explore innovative methods for creating and annotating digital corpora, develop
        speech and language
        technologies suited to IADL, and promote interdisciplinary collaborations. By leveraging LLMs, we seek to
        address the
        complexities of syntax, morphology, and semantics in these languages to enhance the performance of NLP
        applications. Furthermore,
        the workshop will provide a platform for sharing best practices, tools, and resources, enhancing the digital
        infrastructure necessary
        for language preservation. Through collaborative efforts, we aim to build a research community to advance NLP for IADL, contributing to
        linguistic diversity and cultural preservation in the digital age.
        <br>
        <br>
        The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
    <ul type="square" style="color: black;">
        <li>- Large Language Models for Indo-Aryan Languages and Dravidian Languages.</li>
        <li>- Developing a cleaned Indo-Aryan and Dravidian language corpora (UNICODE) and digital linguistic resources.</li>
        <li>- Machine Translation and Cross-Lingual Systems </li>
        <li>- Speech Technologies: Recognition and Synthesis</li>
        <li>- Language Identification and Dialect Detection</li>
        <li>- Information Extraction, OCR systems and Knowledge Modelling</li>
        <li>- NLP Applications - Fake News, Spam, and Rumor Detection </li>
        <li>- Hate speech and Offensive Language Detection </li>
        <li>- Sentiment Analysis and Text Summarisation</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Papers that can cover one or more of these areas are invited to submit.</p>

    <h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
    <!--
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We will accept submissions through OpenReview (submission link TBA). All submissions should use the ACL template
        and formatting requirements specified by ACL. Archival paper must be fully anonymized. Submissions of both types
        can be made through OpenReview (submission link).
    </p> -->
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
       Authors are invited to submit their unpublished work that represents novel research. The papers should be written in English using the *ACL style. Authors can also submit supplementary materials, including technical appendices, source codes, datasets, and multimedia appendices. All submissions, including the main paper and its supplementary materials, should be fully anonymised. For more information on formatting and anonymity guidelines, please refer to COLING 2022 submission guidelines.
        <br><br>
        The workshop accepts both long papers (8 pages) and short papers (4 pages). The paper can include unlimited appendix and references. Upon acceptance, the authors are provided with 1 more page to address the reviewer's comments.
        <br><br>
        All papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed. Two reviewers with the same technical expertise will review each paper. Authors of the accepted papers will present their work in either the Oral or Poster session. All accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings that will be published in ACL Anthology.
    </p>

     
    <p>  Both research paper and shared task paper must be submitted using SoftConf at <a href="https://softconf.com/coling2025/IndoNLP25/ ">https://softconf.com/coling2025/IndoNLP25/ </a></p>
