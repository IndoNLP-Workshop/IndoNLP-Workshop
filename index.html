    <h2>Workshop description</h2>


    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The rapid advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the
        landscape of computational linguistics. However, Indo-Aryan and Dravidian Languages (IADL),
        which represent a significant portion of South Asia's linguistic heritage,
        remain under-resourced and under-researched in these technological developments.
        This workshop aims to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers, linguists, and technologists to focus on
        the unique challenges and
        opportunities. Participants will explore innovative methods for creating and annotating digital corpora, develop
        speech and language
        technologies suited to IADL, and promote interdisciplinary collaborations. By leveraging LLMs, we seek to
        address the
        complexities of syntax, morphology, and semantics in these languages to enhance the performance of NLP
        applications. Furthermore,
        the workshop will provide a platform for sharing best practices, tools, and resources, enhancing the digital
        infrastructure necessary
        for language preservation. Through collaborative efforts, we aim to build a research community to advance NLP for IADL, contributing to
        linguistic diversity and cultural preservation in the digital age.
        <br>
        <br>
        The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
    <ul type="square" style="color: black;">
        <li>- Large Language Models for Indo-Aryan Languages and Dravidian Languages.</li>
        <li>- Developing a cleaned Indo-Aryan and Dravidian language corpora (UNICODE) and digital linguistic resources.</li>
        <li>- Machine Translation and Cross-Lingual Systems </li>
        <li>- Speech Technologies: Recognition and Synthesis</li>
        <li>- Language Identification and Dialect Detection</li>
        <li>- Information Extraction, OCR systems and Knowledge Modelling</li>
        <li>- NLP Applications - Fake News, Spam, and Rumor Detection </li>
        <li>- Hate speech and Offensive Language Detection </li>
        <li>- Sentiment Analysis and Text Summarisation</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Papers that can cover one or more of these areas are invited to submit.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <!--
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We will accept submissions through OpenReview (submission link TBA). All submissions should use the ACL template
        and formatting requirements specified by ACL. Archival paper must be fully anonymized. Submissions of both types
        can be made through OpenReview (submission link).
    </p> -->
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <b>Archival papers of up to 8 pages + references.</b> These are papers reporting on completed, original and
        unpublished research. An optional appendix may appear after the references in the same pdf file. Accepted papers
        are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings of the ACL
        Anthology, meaning they cannot be published elsewhere. They should report on obtained results rather than
        intended work. Broader Impacts/Ethics and Limitations sections are optional and can be included on a 9th page.
        <br><br>
        <b>Non-archival extended abstracts of 2 pages + references.</b> These may report on work in progress or may be
        cross-submissions of work that has already appeared (or is scheduled to appear) in another venue in 2022-2023.
        Abstract titles will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the proceedings. The
        selection will not be based on a double-blind review and thus submissions of this type need not be anonymized.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">We do not have a dedicated short paper track or a minimum page requirement. Authors may submit short papers to
        the archival track, noting that they will be evaluated like all other full papers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Accepted submissions for both tracks will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral
        presentations (determined by the program committee).</p>
    </p>
    <p>  Both research paper and shared task paper must be submitted using SoftConf at <a href="https://softconf.com/coling2025/IndoNLP25/ ">https://softconf.com/coling2025/IndoNLP25/ </a></p>
